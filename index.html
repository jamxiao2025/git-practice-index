            Stake The Stigma (STS) aims to create a secure and open social community platform for women to share and support each other's health and wellbeing around health issues that are often stigmatized topics in the public sphere. STS is a response to the changes in the national legal landscape around reproductive rights and the dangers that people, especially women, are now facing as a result of lack of information and awareness related to these stigmatized topics.
